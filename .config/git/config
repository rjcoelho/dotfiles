# Four files where git config will search for configuration options:
#   $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig - System-wide configuration file.
#   $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config - Second user-specific configuration file. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or empty, $HOME/.config/git/config will be used.
#       Any single-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by whatever is in ~/.gitconfig. It is a good idea not to create this file if you
#       sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for this file was added fairly recently.
#   ~/.gitconfig - User-specific configuration file. Also called "global" configuration file.
#   $GIT_DIR/config - Repository specific configuration file.
